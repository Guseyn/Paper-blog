# Paper-blog
Paper Blog was a minimalistic platform for posting education materials or some other interesting stuff with a convenient WYSIWYG editor for articles creation. It included basic things like the ability to add and edit articles, to write reviews, and to subscribe to userâ€™s favorite authors and topics.

P.S. Yeah, I know, code is terrible, I was too young.
